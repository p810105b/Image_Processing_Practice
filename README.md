## Sampling and Quantization

Exploring fundamental techniques in image processing to modify and analyze pixel values.

- **Sampling Even Pixels:** Sampling image pixels at even positions.
- **Downsampling:** Reducing the image size by a factor of 2.
- **Upsampling:** Restoring the downsampled image from step 2 back to its original size.
- **Quantization:** Reducing the image from 256 gray levels to 8 levels.

## Blur and Edge Detection

Applying various filters and techniques to blur images and detect edges.

- **Average Filter Blur:** Blurring the image using an average filter.
- **Gaussian Filter Blur:** Applying a Gaussian filter for image blurring.
- **Median Filter Blur:** Using a median filter for image blurring.
- **Sobel/Laplacian Edge Detection:** Finding edges using Sobel or Laplacian operators.
- **Canny Edge Detection:** Edge detection using the Canny algorithm.

## Huffman Coding

Implementing Huffman data compression for efficient data representation.

## Morphology

Manipulating image structures using morphological operations.

- **Binary Image Conversion:** Converting the image into a binary format.
- **Dilation and Erosion:** Applying dilation and erosion with a 3x3 structural element.
- **Opening and Closing:** Performing opening and closing operations based on dilation and erosion.
- **Edge Detection:** Finding edges using methods from steps 1 to 3.
